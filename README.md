## ✨ Z-Image

Z-Image is a powerful and highly efficient image generation model family with **6B** parameters. Currently there are four variants:

- 🚀 **Z-Image-Turbo** – A distilled version of Z-Image that matches or exceeds leading competitors with only **8 NFEs** (Number of Function Evaluations). It offers **⚡️sub-second inference latency⚡️** on enterprise-grade H800 GPUs and fits comfortably within **16G VRAM consumer devices**. It excels in photorealistic image generation, bilingual text rendering (English & Chinese), and robust instruction adherence.

- 🎨 **Z-Image** – The foundation model behind Z-Image-Turbo. Z-Image focuses on **high-quality generation**, **rich aesthetics**, **strong diversity**, and **controllability**, well-suited for creative generation, **fine-tuning**, and downstream development. It supports a wide range of artistic styles, effective negative prompting, and high diversity across identities, poses, compositions, and layouts.

## 🔬 Decoupled-DMD: The Acceleration Magic Behind Z-Image

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2511.22677-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22677)

Decoupled-DMD is the core few-step distillation algorithm that empowers the 8-step Z-Image model.

Our core insight in Decoupled-DMD  is that the success of existing DMD (Distribution Matching Distillation) methods is the result of two independent, collaborating mechanisms:

-   **CFG Augmentation (CA)**: The primary **engine** 🚀 driving the distillation process, a factor largely overlooked in previous work.
-   **Distribution Matching (DM)**: Acts more as a **regularizer** ⚖️, ensuring the stability and quality of the generated output.

By recognizing and decoupling these two mechanisms, we were able to study and optimize them in isolation. This ultimately motivated us to develop an improved distillation process that significantly enhances the performance of few-step generation.

![Diagram of Decoupled-DMD](assets/decoupled-dmd.webp)

## 🤖 DMDR: Fusing DMD with Reinforcement Learning

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2511.13649-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13649)

Building upon the strong foundation of Decoupled-DMD, our 8-step Z-Image model has already demonstrated exceptional capabilities. To achieve further improvements in terms of semantic alignment, aesthetic quality, and structural coherence—while producing images with richer high-frequency details—we present **DMDR**.

Our core insight behind DMDR is that Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) can be synergistically integrated during the post-training of few-step models. We demonstrate that:

-   **RL Unlocks the Performance of DMD** 🚀
-   **DMD Effectively Regularizes RL** ⚖️

## 💬 SvelteKit Chat Frontend

A mobile-first chat UI is available in [frontend](frontend). It is intended for fast interface creation around model chat backends.

See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for setup and API payload format.

## 🧩 OpenAI / Ollama-Compatible Python API

You can run a Python server for `Z-image-turbo` that exposes:

- OpenAI-style:
  - `POST /v1/chat/completions`
  - `POST /v1/images/generations`
  - `POST /v1/images/edits`
  - `GET /v1/models`
- Ollama-like:
  - `POST /api/chat`
  - `POST /api/generate`

Start the server:

```bash
pip install -e .
python server.py
```

By default, it listens on `http://0.0.0.0:9090`.

### Performance tuning (GPU)

For high-VRAM GPUs (for example RTX 4090), keep text encoder on GPU for lower latency:

- `ZIMAGE_PARK_TEXT_ENCODER_ON_CPU=0` (default)
- `ZIMAGE_OFFLOAD_TEXT_ENCODER=0` (default)
- `ZIMAGE_CLEAR_CUDA_CACHE_PER_REQUEST=0` (default)

For low-VRAM/OOM-prone setups, enable safer mode:

- `ZIMAGE_PARK_TEXT_ENCODER_ON_CPU=1`
- `ZIMAGE_OFFLOAD_TEXT_ENCODER=1`
- `ZIMAGE_CLEAR_CUDA_CACHE_PER_REQUEST=1`

Optional speed-up: `ZIMAGE_COMPILE=1` (first request is slower due to compile warm-up).

### OpenAI-style example

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Z-image-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "A cinematic night street scene with neon reflections"}
    ],
    "height": 1024,
    "width": 1024,
    "num_inference_steps": 8,
    "guidance_scale": 0.0
  }'
```

### OpenAI-style streaming example

`POST /v1/chat/completions` supports SSE when `"stream": true`.

SSE contract:

- Each frame is a valid `data: {json}` line (plus blank separator).
- Optional side-channel `admin_log` events may appear first.
- Content emits as OpenAI chunks in `choices[0].delta.content`.
- Ordering is deterministic: content chunk(s) → finish chunk (`finish_reason: "stop"`) → optional `final` event → `data: [DONE]`.
- Image payloads are emitted as `{"type":"image_url"}` blocks with URL values (no raw base64 text chunks).

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -N \
  -d '{
    "model": "Z-image-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "A cinematic night street scene with neon reflections"}
    ],
    "stream": true,
    "height": 1024,
    "width": 1024,
    "num_inference_steps": 8,
    "guidance_scale": 0.0
  }'
```

Example SSE frames:

data: {"admin_log":true,"message":"[chat] generated image response","provider":"zimage_server","model":"Z-image-turbo"}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-...","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1730000000,"model":"Z-image-turbo","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Generated image with Z-image-turbo in 0.56s."}]},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-...","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1730000000,"model":"Z-image-turbo","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":[{"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"http://localhost:9090/v1/images/img_..."}}]},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-...","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1730000000,"model":"Z-image-turbo","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}

data: {"final":true,"html":"<p>Generated image with Z-image-turbo in 0.56s.</p><div class=\"mt-4\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9090/v1/images/img_...\"></div>","reasoningHtml":"","contentEmpty":false,"provider":"zimage_server","model":"Z-image-turbo","raw_content":"Generated image with Z-image-turbo in 0.56s."}

data: [DONE]
```

Non-stream (`"stream": false`) response shape:

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": [
          {"type": "text", "text": "Generated image with Z-image-turbo in 0.56s."},
          {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "http://localhost:9090/v1/images/img_..."}}
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "provider": "zimage_server",
  "html": "<p>...</p>",
  "raw_content": "..."
}
```

### Ollama-like example

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/api/chat \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Z-image-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "A watercolor-style mountain village at sunrise"}
    ],
    "options": {
      "height": 1024,
      "width": 1024,
      "num_inference_steps": 8,
      "guidance_scale": 0.0
    }
  }'
```

### Ollama-like streaming example

`POST /api/chat` and `POST /api/generate` support streaming when `"stream": true`.
Responses are newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON), compatible with Ollama-style stream readers.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/api/chat \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -N \
  -d '{
    "model": "Z-image-turbo",
    "stream": true,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "A watercolor-style mountain village at sunrise"}
    ],
    "options": {
      "height": 1024,
      "width": 1024,
      "num_inference_steps": 8,
      "guidance_scale": 0.0
    }
  }'
```

The server returns generated image data in base64 for Ollama-like endpoints.
`POST /v1/chat/completions` returns OpenAI-compatible `message.content` / `delta.content` structures.
`POST /v1/images/generations` supports `response_format: "b64_json"` or `"url"`, and supports `n >= 1`.
`POST /v1/images/edits` is available as a multipart OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`image` required, `mask` optional).

Error contract for OpenAI routes (`/v1/*`) uses OpenAI-compatible envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid model",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "param": "model",
    "code": "model_not_found"
  }
}
```
